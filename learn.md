- literal
- A reference can NEVER outlive the owner: Your lifetime 'a enforces this rule at compile time.
- usize
- Ownership = who holds the key
- Borrowing = temporary access card
- Lifetime = expiration date on the card
- If something can move, it cannot contain references to itself
- Library code -> generics -> compile time polymorphism
- Application code -> trait objects -> run time polymorphism
- Low-level code → std::io::Error
- Mid-level code → parsing / validation
- High-level code → app-specific meaning
- If it compiles, it cannot data-race.
- Ordering in atomic operation
    - SeqCst → safest, slowest
    - Relaxed → fastest, but tricky
    - Use SeqCst unless you fully understand memory ordering
- Mutex → “One at a time”
- RwLock → “Many readers or one writer”
- Atomic → “CPU guarantees this operation is indivisible”
- Rust is safe because it forbids certain patterns.
- Data races are UB, not “wrong output”.
- unsafe: Compiler, step aside — I take responsibility
- unsafe: I know more than the compiler — and I accept the cost.
    - mutex, refCell, atomic, arc build using unsafecell and unsafe
- Rust doesn’t prevent bugs, It prevents classes of bugs.
